Dijkstra's Algorithm Path Planning code instructions:

The operation of the code is very simple:

1). Load in the code and run it.

2). The code will prompt you in the command terminal to provide coordinate inputs
    for both the start and goal node.

3). After inputs have been made, the code will execute and a new window called "Map"
    will show the Dijkstra algorithm search working live.

    Note: depending on the distance between the chosen nodes, this may take 10+ minutes to complete.

4). After a solution has been found, a red line will appear on the Map window showing the optimal path.
    
    Note: Due to aliasing of geometric equations, the sharp corner of the polygon has a small gap
          discontinuity at the upper tip.
